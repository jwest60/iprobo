# Description
This is a basic CLI script written in PHP that creates an OBO for Interpro.

# Usage

You can call the script with `php iprobo.php <file1> <file2>`.

`file1` is the path to the file containing all the entries.

`file2` is the name of the file containing all the parent-child data.

The `ipr.obo` file is the resultant of running the script on the two files in the given `ipr` directory.
